  ### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏ècodeWars!

  ### Goal: Build a strong foundation for JS
One code war per day (minimum) allows the knowledge I already have for JavaScript to be tested. When I encounter a question I dont know, I am know able to research to efficiently fill that knowledge gap. 

Storing these prompts allow me to revisit my past codes and review. 

  ### How to challenge me on CodeWars:

- My username is Tencho992 and I belong to the Resilient Coders Clan!
